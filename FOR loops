Using "for" Loops In Lists
Just as you can also use the if keyword inside of lists (to add elements conditionally), you can also use the for keyword to add multiple items into a list:

final numbers = [5, 6];
final myList = [
  1,
  2,
  for (final num in numbers)
    num
];
In this example, the numbers 5 and 6 will be added to myList (hence myList thereafter is [1, 2, 5, 6]).

This for ... in syntax is a special variation of the for loop that loops through multiple items in a list. You will see it again later in the course - both outside and inside of a list. It will also be explained again later.

The idea behind this loop is to simplify the process of performing some operation on all items in a list.

When used in a list, it's essentially an alternative to the spread operator (...):

final numbers = [5, 6];
final myList = [
  1,
  2,
  ...numbers
];
It can be useful in scenarios where values must be transformed before being added to a list - the for ... in loop can then be used instead of map() + spread operator:

final numbers = [5, 6];
final myList = [
  1,
  2,
  ...numbers.map((n) {
    return n * 2; 
  }) // adds 10 and 12
];
can be replaced with:

final numbers = [5, 6];
final myList = [
  1,
  2,
  for (final num in numbers)
    num * 2 // adds 10 and 12
];
As mentioned, you will learn more about for later in the course.

You can also learn more about for ... in inside of lists here: https://github.com/dart-lang/language/blob/master/accepted/2.3/control-flow-collections/feature-specification.md#repetition

Note: A Typo In The Next Lecture
Just a quick note: In the next lecture, in the questions_summary.dart file, there will be a typo.

Instead of writing

Text(((data['question'] as int) + 1).toString()),
write

Text(((data['question_index'] as int) + 1).toString()),
