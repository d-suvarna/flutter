It is a framework to build user interface with Dart
It is a combination of UI framework and Collection of tools
Flutter will convert the code to machine code based on the platform(eg, Andriod, IOS)

---------------------------
Process:
--> When you run application ,at first flutter will read,analyse,parse the entire code in main application
--> then it will get compiled with the help of dart tools to the machine code of target platform
--> then this machine code gets packaged or bundled into highly optimied code 
--> then this will get executed/deployed in perticuler app

-----------------------
const --> is a keyword of DART language, helps dart to optimize the runtime performance
const startAlignment = Alignment.topRight; 
==> "const" act as "final", which doesnot allow to re-initialise the value and also this value will be locked in during compilation
so this wonnt be executed during execution instead it uses already locked or saved value from the memory/container

trim() --> is a built in method to remove exces space from the beginning and end of a string

used to parse the value to double:-
double.tryParse(12.21) --> would return 12.21
